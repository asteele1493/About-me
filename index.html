            <p> My name is Andra and I'm a 29 year old aspiring developer based in Portland, Oregon.</p>
            <p> I went to university in Austin and initially went for piano performance. I ended up graduating with a 
                Sociology degree, every intention to go to law school, and absolutely no desire to follow through.</p>
            <p> I began cooking professionally and worked as a chef for the next six years. I was laid off of my restaurant
                job once COVID took hold of the hospitality industry, and began coding as a means to learn something different.</p>
            </p>
            <p> I currently work as a sales associate for a USDA processing facility. I know, <strong><em>glamorous</em></strong>. 
                I still work with chefs and I still work with food. I get to have conversations with people all day, every day and I don't think 
                that's a bad gig. My favorite things to do are still cook and think about food, but now I get to do it for fun with my partner
                and pup. Also not a bad gig.</p>
