#### Acknowledgements 

- [ProGit](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2): Even though I've utilized git in my own personal coding experiences, needing to use git in the classroom has been kind of challenging. I have been visiting the ProGit pdf consistently to make sure my workflow makes sense. 
- [GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/kipyegonmark/89fe62493f22d93705d917d634d8eeb2): One of the things I've gleaned thus far in creating repositories is the importance of good README files. I found this resource helpful in knowing what to include. 
- [Eric Meyers] (https://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/): I wasn't sure if this needed to be added since there is a license in the css.reset code, but wanted to include the link to the code here.
